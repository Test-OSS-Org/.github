# Test OSS Organization Name

<!--- ![Your Organization Logo](your-logo-url) --->

This is where you provide a brief description of your organization and what it does.

## Mission

Describe the mission of your organization. This could be what kind of software you aim to build, what problems you're trying to solve, or the community you're trying to serve.

## Projects

This section should include a list of major projects that are part of your organization, with a brief description of each project and a link to its repository.

## Getting Involved

We welcome contributions from everyone. Here are some ways you can contribute:

1. **Code Contributions**: You can contribute code to our open source projects. See the individual project READMEs for more information on how to get started.

2. **Bug Reports**: If you find a bug in one of our projects, please open an issue on the project's GitHub page.

3. **Feature Requests**: Have an idea for a new feature? Open an issue on the project's GitHub page.

4. **GitHub Discussions**: We use GitHub Discussions for general conversations, Q&A, and sharing ideas. Check out the [Discussions](github-link-to-discussions) page of each project to join the conversation. If you have a question or idea that isn't a bug report or feature request, it's likely best suited for a Discussion.

Remember, the best way to contribute is to be respectful, helpful, and open-minded. We're all here to learn and grow together.

## Code of Conduct

A Code of Conduct helps create a safe space for everyone. If you have one, you should include it here.
